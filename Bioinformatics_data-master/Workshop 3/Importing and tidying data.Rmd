# Packages to load...
These packages are required to be able to handle data effectively in R studio: 

* tidyverse
* vroom
* devtools

These can be installed via:
`install.packages("package name", dependencies = TRUE)`

They are run via:
`library(package name)`

# Loading information into R studio

The data required must be read in to R using

`vroom("location of data on desktop/location of data in github)`
* Prefered location is public github as this makes it accessible for everyone 

And then saved as a named vector, as shown below for the workshop three data:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
pop_1_dat <- vroom("to_sort_pop_1.csv")
pop_2_dat <- vroom("to_sort_pop_2.csv")
```
**If the data is found in the repository folder you are working in the full pathway from the desktop is not needed**

# Joining data frames together

Use the `join()` function to combine data sets together. Depending on what parts of the data you want to join. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
combined_pop_data <- full_join(pop_1_dat, pop_2_dat, by = NULL, match = "all")
```
* `by` = if NULL will match all common variables

# Converting *wide* data to *long* form data

This data is wide and so must be converted to long form data for ease of processing.

Use the `pivot_longer()` function and enter the column headings required: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
long_pop_data <- combined_pop_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c( species,
                          primary_threat,
                          secondary_threat,
                          tertiary_threat))
```
* To identify the names of the columns either visualise the combined data or click the vector name in the global environment to produce a pop-out table:

# Changing column headings

To edit column headings use the `name()` function, stating the location of the headings to be changed in `[]` and then creating a list of the new names:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
names(covid_dat)[1:2] <- c("Province.State", "Country.Region")
```

# Renaming observation columns 

As seen is figure 1 there are two columns with R assigned headings 'name' and 'value'. To change these to customised headings we use the pivot_longer function again, keeping the variables we want to remain the same in a vector, and substitute our desired names:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
long_pop_data <- combined_pop_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c( species:tertiary_threat),
               names_to = "date",
               values_to = "abundance")
```

# Splitting one column into two

As seen in figure 2 the population group is joined together with the date therefore these must be separated into a separate 'population' column and 'date' column.

The `tidyr` package must be loaded to be able to use the `separate` function to do this and is used as below:
  `separate(original_column,` 
            `c("new_heading_1", "new_heading_2"), sep = number of spaces in value before columns separated)`
            
In practise:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("tidyr")
finished_data <- long_pop_data %>%
  separate(date, 
           c("population", "date"), sep = 6)
```

# Condenscing actions into one block of code 
Using tidyverse functions:

* `names_pattern = ` and stating where in the string is to be separated
* `values_drop_na = F` to remove rows containing missing data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
long_spp <- combined_pop_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c( species,
                          primary_threat,
                          secondary_threat,
                          tertiary_threat),
               names_to = c("population", "date"),
               names_pattern = "(.*)_(.*)",
               values_drop_na = F,
               values_to = "abundance")
long_spp
```
