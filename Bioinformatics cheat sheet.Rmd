# Feedback so far...

-Add blank lines to break up chunks of code to make it easier to read

-Increase code efficiency by merging multiple variables into one vector

# Table of useful functions

Code  | Meaning
----  | -------
`+`     | Add
`-`     | Subtract
`/`     | Divide
`*`    | Multiply 
`^`     | Power
`Inf`   | Infinite
`NaN`   | Not A Number
`NA`    | Not Available
`c()`   | Combine multiple variables into one vector
`[x]`   | Pull out specific value from vector
`""`    | Create character vectors 
`as.factor(x)` | Converts variable names into factors 
`==` | Equal to
`!=` | Not equal to 
`<` | Less than
`>` | More than
`<=` | Less than or equal to 
`>=` | More than or equal to 
`|` | Or
`%in%` | Within
`&` | To combine multiple logical operators 

# Writing functions

Allows specifying multiple arguments within one custom made function if placed within `{}` brackets 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mm <- function(x){
  ##sort vector from smallest to largest
  ##retrieve first and last value in vector
  MINMAX <- sort(x)[c(1,length(x))]
  ##add `return()` to give wanted value 
  return(MINMAX)
}

```
